# TypeScript Hero

TypeScript Hero is a vscode extension that makes your live easier.
When you are coding a lot of `TypeScript` you may want vscode to automatically
include your imports.

If you search for this feature: here's the solution (and many more). Typescript hero will be extended
in the future and there are many features in the pipeline that will enhance the way you
work with typescript.

## Features at a glance

Here is a brief list, of what TypeScript Hero is capable of:

- Add imports of your project or libraries to your current file
- Add an import for the current name under the cursor
- Intellisense that suggests symbols and automatically adds the needed imports
- Sort and organize your imports (sort and remove unused)
- Restart your debug session when your code changes
